# Welcome to my profile! 😁👋
Hi, my name is Elizabeth. I'm a hobbyist developer applying my skills to create projects which will enhance my work.

I primarily work in Python with increasing experience in C++. I generally prefer compiled, statically typed languages like C++, but recognize the value of interpreted languages like Python for various projects. I mostly use object-oriented programming paradigms for application design.

## Current projects 📄✍️
Currently, I am working on PyDiffeomorph, a Python implementation with GUI of Rhodri Cusack and Bobby Stojanoski's [diffeomorph](https://github.com/rhodricusack/diffeomorph) MATLAB script. My aim is to increase the accessibility of this script for use in both research settings and settings where MATLAB is not easily accessible. I also hope to increase the robustness of the code.

## Completed projects ✅
Once I have completed some projects, they will be listed here.

## My interests 🖥️🎸
I am interested in continuing to learn C++, as well as languages like Rust so that I can improve my backend development skills. I am also interested in continuing to improve my Python skills for data analysis and use in research, as well as for daily use. Finally, I am also interested in learning how to work with databases in SQL and PostgreSQL for personal and possible professional use.

I use Linux on all of my machines and enjoy customizing my desktop experience through the use of tiling window managers with custom configuration files built from the ground up.

Outside of that, I am also a guitarist/vocalist, and generally a creative person. In my free time, I like to write music or play with fellow musicians.
